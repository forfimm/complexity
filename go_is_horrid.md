ITT golang is horrid http://yager.io/programming/go.html
funny thing is that all the negatives that he mentiones are actually not really negative whatsoever. Ease of maintability, simple code,little difference between code complexity of novices and seasoned devs, errors are just values (which makes perfect sense in computational research). All in all screw haters, it is all a matter of personal preference

on the same note, this is a good article on error handlind. Instead of doing error handle per one handler in routing, we can create a generic, well sorta generic really, that would be a type with implied http error handling
